# Writing process

## Think of your audience
Before you begin writing, answer these questions. Sample answers have been included:

Question: Who will read my writing? Answer: Developers with knowledge and experience coding in HTML, CSS, and JS but not necessarily React or GraphQL.

Question: What do I hope my readers will know and/or be able to do after reading it? Answer (example): I hope my readers will be able to successfully add search to their Gatsby site.

Once you answer those questions, create an outline of the topic and think about any coding examples you’ll use (if applicable). This helps to organize your thoughts and make the writing process easier.

## Research
Many times, the information that needs to go in your document already exists somewhere.

Avoid copying and pasting huge chunks of other people’s work and to rather use their work to learn so you can write your own document. If you do quote someone’s work verbatim, reference where you got the information.

Possible sources of great research materials:

Blogposts
Docs 
Video tutorials
Discord, Spectrum, or Twitter conversations
Google search results
Presentations you or others have given
Textbooks
Dreams
Anything else you can think of
Write drafts and get feedback
Technical writing, or the literature of science and technology, is difficult because it requires you to take a technical (usually abstract) topic and explain it in a clear, accurate, and objective manner. You’ll likely go through several rounds of proofreading and editing before you’re happy with your writing.

Also, there’s a community of contributors to support you. Bounce ideas off of them and ask for input on your writing in the Discord chat room and in the GitHub repo.

## Word choice

### Use “you” as the pronoun
Your articles should use the second person (“you”) to help to give it a conversational tone. This way, the text and instructions seem to speak directly to the person reading it. Try to avoid using the first person (“I”, “we”, “let’s”, and “us”).

Using “you” is also more accurate than saying “we,” because typically only one person is reading the tutorial or guide at a time and the person who wrote the tutorial is not actually going through it with them, so “we” would be inaccurate. You might notice that some technical documentation uses third person pronouns and nouns like “they” and “the user,” which add more distance and feel colder than the conversational and warm “you” and “your.”

###  Avoid “easy” and “simple”
Avoid using words like “easy”, “simple,” and “basic” because if users have a hard time completing the task that is supposedly “easy,” they will question their abilities. Consider using more specific descriptors; for example, when you say the phrase “deployment is easy,” what do you really mean? Is it easy because it takes fewer steps than another option? If so, just use the most specific descriptor possible, which in that case would be “this deployment method involves fewer steps than other options.”

### Avoid emojis, slang, and metaphors
Avoid using emojis or emoticons in the Docs and idiomatic expressions / slang, or metaphors. Gatsby has a global community, and the cultural meaning of an emoji, emoticon, or slang may be different around the world. Also, emojis can render differently on different systems.

### Define jargon
Articles should be written with short, clear sentences, and use as little jargon as necessary.

Jargon: (n.) special words or expressions that are used by a particular profession or group and are difficult for others to understand: legal jargon.

All jargon should be defined immediately in plain English. In other words, pretend like your readers have basic coding experience but not necessarily experience with PWAs and the JAMstack (see what happened there? I just used two jargon words that need to be defined); you need to define words that newcomers might have a hard time understanding.

# Writing style

## Write concisely
Concise writing communicates the bare minimum without redundancy. Strive to make your writing as short as possible; this practice will often lead to more accurate and specific writing.

## Use clear hyperlinks
Hyperlinks should contain the clearest words to indicate where the link will lead you. So instead of linking to the word *here* link to *golides’s docs*.

In tutorials that are meant for beginners, use as few hyperlinks as possible to minimize distractions. In docs, it’s ok to include as many hyperlinks as necessary to provide relevant and interesting information and resources.
